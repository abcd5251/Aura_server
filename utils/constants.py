===========
GIA 4Cs introduction:

The GIA 4Cs refer to the four main criteria used to evaluate the quality and value of a diamond, as defined by the Gemological Institute of America (GIA)—the most respected diamond grading authority in the world.

Here’s a breakdown of the 4Cs:

💎 1. Cut
What it is: How well the diamond has been cut and shaped from its rough form.

Why it matters: Affects how the diamond reflects light (brilliance and sparkle).

Grades: Excellent, Very Good, Good, Fair, Poor

💎 2. Color
What it is: The absence of color in a diamond (whiter = higher grade).

Scale: D (colorless) to Z (light yellow or brown)

Note: D-F are considered colorless, G-J near-colorless.

💎 3. Clarity
What it is: The presence of internal flaws (inclusions) or external marks (blemishes).

Scale:

FL (Flawless)

IF (Internally Flawless)

VVS1–VVS2 (Very, Very Slightly Included)

VS1–VS2 (Very Slightly Included)

SI1–SI2 (Slightly Included)

I1–I3 (Included)

💎 4. Carat Weight
What it is: How much the diamond weighs.

1 carat = 0.2 grams

Note: Bigger isn’t always better—it’s about balance with the other Cs.

📝 Summary:
C What it Measures Grading Scale
Cut Sparkle & proportions Excellent → Poor
Color Lack of color D (colorless) → Z (light color)
Clarity Internal/external flaws FL → I3
Carat Weight Measured in carats (1 ct = 0.2 grams)
